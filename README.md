Quantum Secure Direct Communication Simulation  

Overview :
  
This project simulates ''Quantum Secure Direct Communication (QSDC)'' using Qiskit. It demonstrates the principles of quantum cryptography by encoding classical messages into quantum states, enabling secure transmission. The project also simulates eavesdropping attempts and highlights how quantum measurement discrepancies can detect such interference, ensuring secure data exchange.
